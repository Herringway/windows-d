# The D Windows SDK projection

Bindings of Windows SDK in D language based on metadata files generated by [Win32 Metadata Project](https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata/)

## Usage

Build the executable as needed and run it to generate source code files containing bindings for the Windows SDK. Latest run result ca be found [here](https://github.com/rumbu13/windows-d/tree/master/out/windows) 

```
wind --input meta\Windows.Win32.winmd --output out --ignore cfg\ignore.cfg --replace cfg\replace.cfg 
```

Build and run were tested on Windows, but the code is not platform dependent, it should work also on Linux.

*Note*: this is a less than 'alpha' version, please expect bugs.
